They are on a mission to restore the timeline which has been corrupted by a powerful and mysterious force. The friends must travel through time and space to find clues and evidence of the nefarious force, while also finding ways to undo the damage it has caused. Along the way they encounter many strange and mysterious creatures, and they must battle them all while also trying to keep themselves safe. As they travel further back in time, they eventually stumble upon the origin of the force, and must make a final stand against it. They eventually succeed in restoring the timeline, and are rewarded with a newfound appreciation for the power of friendship and the importance of preserving the timeline.\n"
